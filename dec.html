        <p>You were the most unexpected thing to happen, the least person to talk to. <br> But it was the best, most
            perfect
            and simply the one. <br> I'm so grateful to that day, to the thought that came across my mind to say sorry
            for
            not being there for a person I barely know in a day off work. <br> <q>You're the exception of my whole life
                and
                the 180-degree turn of it.</q></p>
