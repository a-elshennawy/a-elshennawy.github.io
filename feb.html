        <p>
            it was the day i came back .. 2 days without you were more than enough to teach me
            a lesson that i can't do it
            without you. <br>
            it took me alot to forgive myself, it took me alot to accept myself again and be the person you deserve.
            and i hope i will be that person one day my little girl.
